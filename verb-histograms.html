                <h3>Verb Histograms</h3>
                <p>
                    Verb Histograms is a tool in the <i>Visualizing Russian</i> suite that 
                    visualizes the relative frequencies of different constructions associated 
                    with different verbs. The idea of constructions comes from 
                    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_grammar'>Construction Grammar</a>,
                    which posits that <i>constructions</i>, or learned pairings of linguistic patterns with meanings,
                    are the fundamental building blocks of human language. Prepositions play a big role 
                    in Russian verb constructions. For example the verb "to play", or <i>igrat'</i> (играть),
                    is often used with two prepositions: <i>na</i> (на) and <i>v'</i> (в), which both mean 
                    something similar to "in" or "on." However, the choice of preposition one uses with
                    <i>igrat'</i> essentially determines its meaning. <i>Na</i> indicates a playing a 
                    musical instrument, while <i>v'</i> indicates playing a sport.
                    For example: You can say <i>igrat' na (piano)</i> and <i>igrat' v' (soccer)</i>, 
                    but you can't say <i>igrat' na (soccer)</i> or <i>igrat' v (piano)</i>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Verb Histogram Tool shows which prepositions, cases, and expressions are used 
                    most frequently with certain verbs. Clicking on the bar graph itself shows 
                    the real examples from the corpus which comprise the statistics shown in the graph.

                    Of course, Russian is a complex language, and many, many, different constructions 
                    can be found surrounding the same verb, but it is helpful to know which constructions 
                    are most common to a certain verb, or what words frequently occur with a certain verb.

                        Demo of the Verb Histogram Tool on the verb "to think", or <i>dumat'</i> (думать).
                        The top part of the tool is a dashboard showing the most common constructions across 
                        all instances of the verb found in the corpus. For "to think," the most common 
                        collection of constructions were "думать + [ о/об + LOC ]" (to think about something)
                        and "думать + [ , что ]" (to think that...). A list of frequently co-occurring words 
                        is also shown, helping users understand the phrasal context of the verb.

                        <b>Below:</b> Graph of the different constructions of "to think." The common constructions
                        pointed out in the dash are reinforced in the graph, along with a multitude of other
                        possible constructions. The horizontal axis refers to the place in the sentence where 
                        the particular construction begins (3 words before the verb, 2 words before the verb, etc.):

                        Clicking on "NOM" shows that the nominative case shows up in the -1 and +1 positions 
                        around the verb, but about 4 times more frequently before (in this corpus):

                        <b>Below:</b> It is also possible to view the examples comprising the statistics shown 
                        on the graph. For example, here we see sentences from the corpus where ", что" (that) that occur 
                        in the +1 position of the verb "to think".
