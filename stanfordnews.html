                <h3>Comparing Western News and Russian Propaganda</h3>
                <p>
                    In general, which features of language distinguish propaganda from independent news?, and
                    specifically, How can temporal, linguistic, and emotional features inform us on these differences?
                    Answering these questions will provide a greater understanding of how to detect propaganda and
                    understand its linguistic strategies of persuasion, a pressing issue as the online information war
                    becomes a greater threat around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use 3 types of computational analysis to investigate my research questions. These are thematic,
                    which I conduct with topic modeling; stylistic, using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC), and
                    a mixed-level analysis
                    using sentiment analysis and the results from my topic modeling. Together, these 3 levels of
                    analysis reveal different features and patterns for textual analysis.

                        On inspecting topic frequency over time, we find that the drop in frequency for
                        "Military Tension" in Russian outlets is balanced out by increases in "Dialogue of Diplomacy"
                        and "Denial of Accusations," and these topics stayed the same or decreased in Western outlets
                        during the same time period. On qualitative inspection, this suggests that as Western
                        governments gave more attention to Russia's military buildup, the Russian government downplayed
                        the military crisis during this time period by resorting to rhetoric of deflection and
                        deescalation.
