                <h3>Visualizing Russian</h3>
                <p>I have supported the Visualizing Russian project by helping to brainstorm, design, prototype,
                    and implement various data-based web tools for Russian language learning in D3.js, Javascript, HTML,
                    and CSS.
                    For many of the tools, I designed novel visualizations based on language data.
                    Some of the tools featured on the site are <a>Quick Lemma</a>, <a>Word Formation</a>,
                    <a>Similarity Tool</a>, <a>Verb Histograms, </a>and the <a>Case Radar Charts</a>.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: small;">From the <i>Visualizing Russian</i> website:</p>

                    (<a
                        href='https://visualizingrussian.fas.harvard.edu'>https://visualizingrussian.fas.harvard.edu</a>)
                    is a suite of tools benefiting
                    language learners, teachers, and researchers and enabling each user-group to access the
                    complex system of the Russian language through visualization methods in order to leverage
                    the powers of compression and expansion of a massive dataset.
                <p>Tools developed so far
                    analyze texts for relative difficulty with regard to vocabulary content, create frequency lists
                    and display word forms used for each lemma in a text, compare target vocabulary to coverage
                    in a text, identify the most commonly used word forms for a lemma, compare the relative
                    frequency of near-synonyms or other items in a semantic domain, show the usage of nouns
                    with various cases or verbs with various person/number/tense/aspect combinations, and
                    identify the case governance or preposition usage of Russian verbs. </p>

                <p>Additional tools break
                    down word-formation for prefixes-roots-suffixes in words and identify the field of
                    morphologically-related or semantically-related words for any target word. These tools have
                    contributed to the creation of a new Russian textbook series, Foundations of Russian (Clancy,
                    Egorova, Green, Willis, forthcoming from Routledge Publishers), which presents a 4000-word
                    vocabulary based on the most frequently occurring and communicatively necessary words in
                    Russian.

                <p>
                    Quick Lemma is a tool in the <i>Visualizing Russian</i> suite that presents frequency data about
                    different sets of words.</p>
                <p>This screenshot shows a comparison of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
                    Saturday, Sunday in Russian. The most frequent word is Wednesday, <i>sreda</i> (среда),
                    which makes sense, because <i>sreda</i> actually has a meaning other than the day of the
                    week. <i>Sreda</i> also means environment or medium, so the word itself has a higher frequency
                    than other words. The graph on the right also shows that Sunday, or <i>vosrekresene</i>
                    (воскресенье),
                    has a generally higher frequency than the other days of the week. This can be attributed to
                    <i>voskresene</i>'s true meaning, which is"resurrection."

                <p>
                    The name for the Word Formation tool in Russian is <i>slovoobrazovanie</i>
                    (словообразование), literally meaning "word formation" or "word derivation".
                    Like the name suggests, the tool presents information related to word roots,
                    showing users the common derivation of different families of words. Learning
                    the meaning or association of different word roots can be very helpful to Russian
                    language learners because in Russian the 228 most common roots produce upwards of
                    20,000 words, an average of 90 words per root
                    (<a href='https://slavica.indiana.edu/bookListings/textbooks/Leveraging_Russian'>source</a>).

                    <p>
                        In my research, I have been experimenting with building
                        <a href='https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/spider'>radar charts</a>, also called spider charts or
                        web charts,
                        to present linguistic information. These are a two-dimensional chart type designed
                        to plot one or more series of values over multiple quantitative variables.
                        Each variable has its own axis, all axes are joined in the center of the figure.
                        These types of charts are sometimes criticized for being difficult or misleading
                        to interpret because of its circular layout, often random category ordering, and
                        portrayal of point information as area. However, I have found that they are an
                        effective graph for showing linguistic information that is based on
                        relative frequency of categorical information.

                                action is incomplete, while perfective is used when the action is complete.)
                                The aspect gauge in the bottom left shows that "to read" more frequently occurs in the
                                imperfective aspect than the perfective aspect, implying that people more often
                                refer to the "process" of reading rather than the "completion" of reading.
