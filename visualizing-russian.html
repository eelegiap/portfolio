                    Visualizing Russian 
                    (<a href='https://visualizingrussian.fas.harvard.edu'>https://visualizingrussian.fas.harvard.edu</a>)
                    is a suite of tools benefiting
                    language learners, teachers, and researchers and enabling each user-group to access the
                    complex system of the Russian language through visualization methods in order to leverage
                    the powers of compression and expansion of a massive dataset. Tools developed so far
                    analyze texts for relative difficulty with regard to vocabulary content, create frequency lists
                    and display word forms used for each lemma in a text, compare target vocabulary to coverage
                    in a text, identify the most commonly used word forms for a lemma, compare the relative
                    frequency of near-synonyms or other items in a semantic domain, show the usage of nouns
                    with various cases or verbs with various person/number/tense/aspect combinations, and
                    identify the case governance or preposition usage of Russian verbs. Additional tools break
                    down word-formation for prefixes-roots-suffixes in words and identify the field of
                    morphologically-related or semantically-related words for any target word. These tools have
                    contributed to the creation of a new Russian textbook series, Foundations of Russian (Clancy,
                    Egorova, Green, Willis, forthcoming from Routledge Publishers), which presents a 4000-word
                    vocabulary based on the most frequently occurring and communicatively necessary words in
                    Russian.

                <p>I have supported this project by helping to brainstorm, design, prototype,
                    and implement various data-based tools for Russian language learning. Some of
                    the tools featured on the site are <a>Quick Lemma</a>, <a>Word Formation</a>,
                    <a>Similarity Tool</a>, <a>Verb Histograms, </a>and the <a>radar charts</a>.

                        Example of the text parsing tool on the first few paragraphs of Anna Karenina.
                        Words are colored by level, and users can click on any word to see extended 
                        grammatical information on the right hand side. Here, the parser shows that the
                        word <i>smeshalos'</i> or смешалось is a perfective verb that occurs in the neuter past form.
                        The verb <i>smeshat'sa</i> (here meaning "to become mixed up/confused") is shown to have 
                        a 30-70 split of the imperfective vs. perfective forms based on frequency data in our database.
