                <h3>Radar Charts</h3>
                <p>
                    In my research, I have been experimenting with building 
                    <a href='https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/spider'>radar charts</a>, also called spider charts or web charts,
                    to present linguistic information. These are a two-dimensional chart type designed 
                    to plot one or more series of values over multiple quantitative variables. 
                    Each variable has its own axis, all axes are joined in the center of the figure.
                    These types of charts are sometimes criticized for being difficult or misleading
                    to interpret because of its circular layout, often random category ordering, and
                    portrayal of point information as area. However, I have found that they are an 
                    effective graph for showing linguistic information that is based on 
                    relative frequency of categorical information.

                    I have experimented with building radar charts for showing the distribution of the 
                    6 Russian cases (nominative, accusative, locative, instrumental, dative, genitive)
                    across nouns in the abridged Russian National Corpus, a large collection of real
                    Russian texts. The charts show how often a word will occur in different cases.
                    For example, the word <i>karandash</i> (карандаш), pencil, should intuitively 
                    occur most frequently in the instrumental case <i>karandashom</i> (карандашом), meaning 
                    "with a pencil."
                    I have also built radar charts summarizing the frequency of different verb forms for 
                    some verb infinitive. Of course, different verb forms do not all occur in equal 
                    frequency across the intersections of feminine, masculine, and neuter and past, present, and future.
                </p>

                    Understanding the case breakdown or verb form distribution of words can 
                    help language learners master the most critical word forms. This is more 
                    critical to Russian than English, for example, because Russian encodes 
                    so much information in word form, and subsequently, there is a great abundance 
                    of forms for every word. For example, some verbs boast upwards of 60 forms for one infinitive! 
                    For example, 40+ forms of the verb <i>begat'</i> (бегать), meaning "to run", can be found
                    <a href='http://masterrussian.com/verbs/begat_pobezhat.htm'>here</a>.

                        Demo of the <b>case distribution tool</b> on <i>list</i> (лист) meaning "leaf" in 
                        Russian. The dots indicate the frequency with which the singular or plural 
                        form of the word occurs in each case category. The graph shows that the word
                        <i>list</i> more frequently shows up in plural than singular, and especially 
                        in the instrumental case (with leaves) and the genitive case (of leaves):

                        <b>Below:</b> Demo of the <b>verb distribution tool</b> on the verb <i>chitat'</i>
                        (читать), meaning "to read." The graph shows both the imperfective and 
                        perfective forms of the verb. (Roughly, imperfective is used when the 
                        action is incomplete, while perfective is used when the action is complete.)
                        The aspect gauge in the bottom left shows that "to read" more frequently occurs in the 
                        imperfective aspect than the perfective aspect, implying that people more often 
                        refer to the "process" of reading rather than the "completion" of reading.

                        <b>Below:</b> Chart showing the verb form breakdown in more detail. In the texts
                        in the corpus, the verb seems to show up most frequently in its imperfective infinitive form ("to read")
                        and imperfective past masculine form ("he read"). In the present tense, <i>chitat'</i> is most frequently 
                        found in its first person singular ("I read") and third person singular ("we read") forms.
