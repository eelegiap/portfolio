                     interests in
                    social media data, Eastern European politics, Russian linguistics, and poetry.

                    the poetry dataset I curated. I studied Russian-language poetry, but as the map shows, authors writing in 
                    Russian are not necessarily from the Russian Federation. Russian-language poetry is written by authors encompassing a 
                    diversity of cultural, ethnic, and national backgrounds. </p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b>
                        My thesis explores the changes in Russophone poetry before and after the Russian invasion of
                        Ukraine on February 24th, 2022, by developing and analyzing a novel database of 3,222
                        Russian-language poems posted to the internet from 2017 to 2022. The interdisciplinary study employs
                        a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, such as computational semantic analyses and
                        close readings, to uncover the shifting relationships between language and politics in Russophone
                        poetry. <b>The findings reveal authors' deepening estrangement from the Russian language and a changing
                        thematic landscape. Post-invasion poetry exhibited an increased focus on themes of war, morality,
                        and mortality and a diminished focus on nature, memory, and everyday human experiences.</b> The research
                        highlights the potential of natural language processing for detecting larger-scale thematic shifts
                        in text. This study also emphasizes the value of poetry as a subject that can enhance our
                        understanding of the political and historical moment.</p>
