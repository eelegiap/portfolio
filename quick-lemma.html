                <p>
                    Quick Lemma is a tool in the <i>Visualizing Russian</i> suite that presents frequency data about
                    different sets of words. Users can input their own sets of words (like days of the week, colors,
                    different prepositions, synonyms) to compare their relative frequencies in current corpora and over
                    time. There is also an option to view all morphological variations on a word. Russian is a
                    morphologically rich language, which means that the language encodes a lot of information in 
                    different word forms. I developed this tool from start to finish.

                        This screenshot shows a comparison of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, 
                        Saturday, Sunday in Russian. The most frequent word is Wednesday, <i>sreda</i> (среда),
                        which makes sense, because <i>sreda</i> actually has a meaning other than the day of the
                        week. <i>Sreda</i> also means environment or medium, so the word itself has a higher frequency
                        than other words. The graph on the right also shows that Sunday, or <i>vosrekresene</i> (воскресенье), 
                        has a generally higher frequency than the other days of the week. This can be attributed to
                        <i>voskresene</i>'s true meaning, which is"resurrection."
