                <h3>Detained in Danger</h3>
                <p>Completed early on in my tech journey, I worked on this project with Human Rights First in 2020 to
                    map how COVID-19 was spreading in ICE detention centers.

                        tested positive for COVID-19 in ICE detention centers across the USA.</p>

                    <p><b>Excerpt from article about database:</b>
                        The Harvard College Data Analytics Group, under the auspices of Human Rights First, today
                        launched Detained In Danger (www.detainedindanger.org), a database that tracks COVID-19 in ICE
                        detention centers.
                        <br />
                        The data, which shows a disregard for CDC distancing protocols, haphazard testing, and a
                        continually rising rate of COVID-19 infection, raises troubling questions about how
                        asylum-seekers and other detainees are being treated by ICE during this pandemic.
                        <br />
                        “It’s shocking to see in detail in how many ways ICE is ignoring CDC guidelines for coronavirus
                        at the detention centers it runs,” said Welton Chang, Chief Technology Officer at Human Rights
                        First. “Without Harvard College Analytics Group’s data, leaders might say they’re trying to
                        ameliorate these conditions. Real-time analysis suggests that this kind of abuse may actually be
                        ICE policy. It’s so pervasive, it may as well be.”
