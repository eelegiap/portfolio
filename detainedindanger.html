                <h3>Detained in Danger</h3>
                <p>Early on in my tech journey in 2020, I worked on this project with Human Rights First and Harvard College
                    Analytics Group to uncover how COVID-19 was spreading in ICE detention centers.
                </p>
                <p>We scraped data from official ICE websites to create this D3.js visualization and webpage (now
                    defunct). The visualization updated in real time based on changes to the ICE websites. Overall, the project shone
                    light on the serious spread of the virus within immigration detention centers.</p>

                <p>
                    The Harvard College Data Analytics Group, under the auspices of Human Rights First, today
                    launched Detained In Danger, a database that tracks COVID-19 in ICE
                    detention centers.</p>
                <p>
                    The data, which shows a disregard for CDC distancing protocols, haphazard testing, and a
                    continually rising rate of COVID-19 infection, raises troubling questions about how
                    asylum-seekers and other detainees are being treated by ICE during this pandemic.</p>
                <p>
                    “It’s shocking to see in detail in how many ways ICE is ignoring CDC guidelines for coronavirus
                    at the detention centers it runs,” said Welton Chang, Chief Technology Officer at Human Rights
                    First. “Without Harvard College Analytics Group’s data, leaders might say they’re trying to
                    ameliorate these conditions. Real-time analysis suggests that this kind of abuse may actually be
                    ICE policy. It’s so pervasive, it may as well be.”</p>
